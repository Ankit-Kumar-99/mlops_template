# Testing

## Overview

The `testing` folder is designed to write and manage test cases related to models, data processing, and other components of the MLOps framework. This ensures that the code is robust, reliable, and meets the expected performance and accuracy standards.

## Structure

- **`test.py`**: A sample script demonstrating how to initialize a test environment and run basic test functions.


### Writing Test Cases

The DS team can add their test scripts in this folder. These test scripts can include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Model accuracy tests
- Data validation tests
- Integration tests for data pipelines
- Performance benchmarks
