def main_evaluate():
    """
    Evaluate model metrics.

    This function serves as the main entry point for evaluating the performance
    of a machine learning model. It prints a message indicating that model metrics
    evaluation is taking place. You can extend this function to include specific
    evaluation logic, such as calculating and displaying various performance metrics.

    Usage:
    Call this function when you want to start the evaluation process for your model.
    You can customize the evaluation steps within this function to suit your needs.

    Example:
        def main_evaluate():
            print("Evaluating model metrics")
            # Add your evaluation logic here
            # e.g., calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
            metrics = evaluate_model(model, test_data)
            print(f"Model accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']}")
            print(f"Model precision: {metrics['precision']}")
            print(f"Model recall: {metrics['recall']}")
            print(f"Model F1-score: {metrics['f1_score']}")

    Note:
    Ensure that you have the necessary model and test data loaded before calling this function.
